## Introduction

TermSnake is a simple snake game written in Python3 and using the curses library to display the game on the terminal.

It only works on linux. If you want to play it on windows, you can try to modify the source code with [UniCurses](https://pypi.org/project/UniCurses) library, or run it on WSL.

## How to download

Just clone the repository or download the zip file from [releases page](https://github.com/Jacken-Wu/TermSnake/releases) and extract it.

## How to play

1. Run `python3 main.py` in the terminal.
2. Use the arrow keys to move the snake.
3. Quit the game by pressing `q`.

Your goal is to eat as many "foods" as possible without hitting the walls or yourself. Good luck!
